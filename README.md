This file achieve three different coding techniques including Shannon, Fano and Huffman coding.  
A Game of Thrones.txt is the test file.  
【*Operational Guide*】
(1)Firstly,use Preprocessing.exe to get A Game of Thrones_Preprocess.txt
(2)To use Fano coding process, open Fano_coding directionary
     1)Encoding must be operated first, click Fano_encoder.exe
     2)Then click Fano_decoder.exe to achieve decoding process
(3)To use Shannon coding process, open Shannon_coding directionary
     1)Encoding must be operated first, click Shannon_encoder.exe
     2)Then click Shannon_decoder.exe to achieve decoding process
(4)To use Huffman coding process, open Huffman_coding directionary
     1)Encoding must be operated first, click Huffman_encoder.exe
     2)Then click Huffman_decoder.exe to achieve decoding process
