This file achieve three different coding techniques including Shannon, Fano and Huffman coding.  
A Game of Thrones.txt is the test file.  

Operational Guide
----
- Firstly,use Preprocessing.exe to get A Game of Thrones_Preprocess.txt 
- To use Fano coding process, open Fano_coding directionary 
     - Encoding must be operated first, click Fano_encoder.exe
     - Then click Fano_decoder.exe to achieve decoding process
- To use Shannon coding process, open Shannon_coding directionary
     - Encoding must be operated first, click Shannon_encoder.exe
     - Then click Shannon_decoder.exe to achieve decoding process 
- To use Huffman coding process, open Huffman_coding directionary  
     - Encoding must be operated first, click Huffman_encoder.exe
     - Then click Huffman_decoder.exe to achieve decoding process
